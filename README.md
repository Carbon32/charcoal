# Python Editor: 
A custom Python Code Editor, fully written in Python. I kept the editor as simple as possible.
The editor supports basic open/save/copy/cut/paste/select features and uses Windows Command Prompt to run the written Python scripts.

**Keybinds:**

CTRL + N: New file

CTRL + L: Open file

CTRL + S: Save File

CTRL + F: Save File As

CTRL + B: Run File

CTRL + C: Copy

CTRL + X: Cut

CTRL + V: Paste

CTRL + A: Select All

CTRL + Z: Undo

CTRL + Y: Redo
